Notes about Recursion:
IN our recursive call of the recursion method:
We must have an IN THEN statement:
This is the pseudo code for the pattern of recursion
In computer science, this is part of 
Algorithms and Data Structures.
The big issue with RECURSION IS: HOW do transmit information about the variable we are recursing on from one stack frame to the next stack frame
method Recursion{
if (guard variable == 0) // if you have met the condition where
					// you want to STOP recursing
	{return 0;}		// return a definite value
// this is the way you escape from the INFINITE recursion !

else {
	// if you have not met your GUARD condition, then you recurse
	Rucursion();
}
